## Introduction
The repository contains code of thesis project titled, "Meta Learning for Automated DataPre-processing for clustering". The objective of the thesis project is to 
provide a data preprocessing pipeline for unsupervised clustering leveraging meta learning method. 
### Abstract
Data pre-processing is an integral part of any data analysis project. There are wide range of Data pre-processing methods, such as replacing missing values, scaling, and data reduction. The aim of this project is to automate data pre-processing by leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). While supervised learning has been in core focus of AutoML research, unsupervised learning remained comparatively less unexplored. Therefore, the thesis focuses on suggesting a data pre-processing pipeline for an unsupervised clustering task by exploiting meta-learning space and meta learners in a domain-agnostic manner for users who does not have in depth knowledge of the machine learning algorithms and how data preprocessing changes the data and the behavior of the algorithms. The thesis explores the potential of integrating data preprocessing in the cSmartML tool for unsupervised clustering. The proposed method applies meta learning and creates a knowledge space applying three clustering algorithms and a seven data transformation methods to transform the data. The knowledge space contains multi CVI ranking correlation score for original and transformed data that are clustered individually for three algorithms. The clustering algorithms were also tuned with a range of hyper-parameters to find the best setting. From the initial results, it is shown that data preprocessing or transformation improves the clustering result and it also shows comparatively better result when compared again cSmartML results. This shows that data preprocessing for unsupervised clustering task is important. Additionally based on the meta learning space, the project also proposes user a data preprocessing pipeline for further clustering.

There are two notebook files and a meta_data.csv in this repository. 
Notebook 1 contains the code for meta space creation. Meta space is the meta data or the knowledge base on which the experiment was performed. Notebook 2 holds code for the analysis. Each of the notebook has comments to describe the code. After creating each dataset for each clustering algorithm, all of the datasets are concatenated and meta_data.csv was created.
